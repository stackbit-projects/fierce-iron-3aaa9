Avoid using heading tags to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size property. Headings use size to indicate their relative importance, but CSS is preferred for general-purpose resizing.

## Quoting

The HTML blockquote element defines a long block quotation in the HTML document from another source.

>Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Design is knowing which ones to keep. <cite>â€• Scott Adams</cite>

A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the &lt;cite&gt; element.

## Unordered Lists

Groups a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

+ Donec non tortor in arcu mollis feugiat
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit
+ Donec id eros eget quam aliquam gravida
+ Vivamus convallis urna id felis
+ Nulla porta tempus sapien

## Ordered Lists

Represents a list of items. The only difference from the unordered list is taht the order of the items is meaningful.

1. Donec non tortor in arcu mollis feugiat
2. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit
3. Donec id eros eget quam aliquam gravida
4. Vivamus convallis urna id felis
5. Nulla porta tempus sapien
