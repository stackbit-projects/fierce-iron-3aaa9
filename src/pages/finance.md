> For financing we use following source of funding

## Friends and Family


Finance plays an important role for smooth running of any buisness.

We launch our buisness with friends-and-family round. Friends and family give us loan or they invest in our buisness .

This is the most appropriate and flexible way of funding beacuse :- 

* They lend money with no interest or even with small rate of interest.

* Smooth and sound relation with family and friends.

* They gave time to build or establish the business.

* They listen to our pitch as they care about us.

* They agree to a longer repayment period or lower return on their investment than formal lenders.
